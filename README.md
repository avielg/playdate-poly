## ToDo
- [ ] Scorpion is moving faster when the tunnel is straight, slower when it's full of turns (this is the basic logic of running away vs losing the game...)
- [ ] Rocks interrupting the poly that it needs to go around
- [ ] Food to collect points (besides how low we got...)
- [ ] Poly can poop, it takes X seconds, but then delays the Scorpion by Y seconds when he reaches the poop
