# playdate-poly

Much of the game's logic is based on the Izopod (Roly Poly) real life and behavior, as found in related research.

_(from M. Shachak (1980) Energy Allocation and Life History Strategy of the Desert lsopod)_

## ToDo
- [ ] Scorpion is moving faster when the tunnel is straight, slower when it's full of turns (this is the basic logic of running away vs losing the game...)
- [ ] Rocks interrupting the poly that it needs to go around
- [ ] Food to collect points (besides how low we got...)
- [ ] Poly can poop, it takes X seconds, but then delays the Scorpion by Y seconds when he reaches the poop

### Current State
Poly can dig, the screen scrolls up/down to folloy poly.
A scorpion chases poly, following its path, if they touch - game over.
